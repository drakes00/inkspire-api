{{ prompt }} The growing interconnection between the digital and physical worlds has given\n  rise to a new generation of systems, where connected objects control and\n  manage physical processes. Historically confined to specific environments\n  like factories, nuclear power plants, or dams, these systems, often referred\n  to as #gls('ics'), and often misnamed by the broader term #gls('scada'), have\n  spread throughout all layers of our society. Today, critical #gls('iot')\n  encompasses fields as diverse as water and electricity distribution,\n  transportation (autonomous vehicles, traffic lights), smart buildings, and\n  the healthcare sector with connected medical devices.\n\n  This transition has blurred the lines between traditional #gls('it') systems,\n  which is data-centric, and #gls('ot'), which acts on the physical world.\n  These two fields, long perceived as distinct, are now forced to converge and\n  the cultural and technical gap that may have existed between IT experts and\n  physical systems engineers has become an obstacle, even as collaboration is\n  essential. The need for professionals capable of interfacing between these\n  two worlds is now crucial for designing systems that are both innovative and\n  secure.\n\n  In this manuscript, we focus on the cybersecurity of these critical systems.\n  Their ubiquity in essential aspects of our lives, combined with a design that\n  historically did not prioritize defense against malicious attacks, makes them\n  prime targets. Initially protected by their physical isolation, their\n  connection to open networks exposes them to a multitude of attackers: from\n  states waging hybrid warfare to criminal groups seeking ransom, as well as\n  hacktivists or terrorists. The objectives of these attacks are just as\n  varied, ranging from espionage to outright sabotage. This new reality has\n  made the subject highly sensitive, leading to the drafting of numerous laws,\n  standards, and best practice guides by government agencies and industrial\n  consortia.\n\n  Fortunately, these systems are not without any protection. The field of\n  operational safety (safety) has for decades developed robust methods to\n  ensure that a system remains in a stable state and can withstand failures,\n  errors, or even natural disasters. However, safety generally does not account\n  for the intentionality of an attacker actively seeking to do harm.\n  Conversely, cybersecurity (security) focuses on the methods an attacker could\n  use to take control of a system, often without a deep understanding of the\n  resulting physical impact.\n\n  The fundamental questions we seek to address in this manuscript lie precisely\n  at the intersection of these two worlds: *assuming an attacker has gained\n  control of a part of the system, what are they capable of doing next?* Are\n  they able to gain advantage from their attack to harm the physical process or\n  will they remain confined to the IT world? Also, practically speaking, is it\n  worth preventing a potential attack that would only target a low-criticality\n  part of the system? Could the most efficient countermeasures to circumvent\n  the attack also jeopardize the safety of the industrial system?\

# InkSpire API

![](https://github.com/drakes00/inkspire-api/actions/workflows/phpunit.yaml/badge.svg)

This is the backend API for InkSpire, a modern web-based text editor. It provides all the necessary services for the [InkSpire Frontend](../inkspire-frontend) to function.

---

## ✨ Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides a complete set of endpoints for file and directory management.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures the API using JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication.

---

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) — A set of reusable PHP components and a PHP framework to build web applications.
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 8.2+

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 8.2 or later
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd inkspire-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file and configure your database connection and other variables. You will need to generate the JWT keys.
    ```bash
    php bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair
    ```
    This will generate `config/jwt/private.pem` and `config/jwt/public.pem` and update your `.env` file.

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    php bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=dev
    php bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=dev
    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
    php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
    ```

6. **Create file storage folder:**
    ```bash
    mkdir var/files
    ```

7.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    symfony server:start
    ```

The API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
